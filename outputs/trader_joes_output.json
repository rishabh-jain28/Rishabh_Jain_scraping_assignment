    "description": "Trader Joe's Pizza Seasoned Crackers are the mini, snackable version of pizza you didn't know you needed! \r\n\r\nOriginating in Naples, pizza marinara is likely the oldest variety of tomato-topped pizza, and is the flavor profile \r\nwe draw from for these unique Crackers. True to the source material, they're generously seasoned with the \r\npizza marinara trinity of tangy tomatoes, aromatic oregano, and a kick of garlic. Thin, wheat-based Crackers \r\nstand in for pizza crust to facilitate satisfying crispiness, optimal snackability, and an uncanny resemblance to \r\nthe real deal. \r\n\r\nTo make the Crackers extra pizza-like, we recommend swinging by our cheese section and scooping up your \r\ncheese of choice-we're partial to All Natural Fresh Mozzarella Cheese [sku 077726]. Add cold cheese slices for \r\na lighter feel, or melt them slightly for peak pizza replication. Pour a glass of Italian red wine (like Villa Cerrina \r\nMontepulciano D'Abruzzo [sku 048838]), or a pint of pilsner for elevated snackage during evening wind-downs \r\nand cozy gatherings with family and friends. Any way you slice it, Pizza Seasoned Crackers make for fun and \r\nflavorful munchies whenever you're feeling peckish!\r\n\r\nPizza Seasoned Crackers",
